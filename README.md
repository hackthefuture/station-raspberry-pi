## Glossary

Raspberry Pi is a great platform for teaching computing from the ground up.
Let's start the group off with some terminology.

* Raspberry Pi - A single-board computer, designed for teaching computing from the ground up
* Raspbian - The flagship operating system for Pi, based on Debian Linux
* ARM - The instruction set used by Raspberry Pi and most mobile phones
* Minecraft Pi (MCPI) - A fork of Minecraft Bedrock Edition (a.k.a. Minecraft Pocket Edition or MCPE) designed for teaching programming.
* Python - the language used by Minecraft Piâ€™s API
* pip - a package manager for Python, which we use to install the "mcpi" library
* Java - The language that Minecraft Java Edition (formerly known as Minecraft PC edition) is written in
* C++ - The language that Minecraft Bedrock Edition (also known as Minecraft Pocket Edition or MCPE) is written in.
* Linux (Debian) - The OS that Raspbian is based on.
* Open GL ES - Open Graphics Library for Embedded Systems, used to render 3D on the Pi
* GPIO - General Purpose Input Output (the pins)
* Raspberry Pi Zero - A Pi the size of a stick of gum
